Rock climbing at Teibaila starts with a vertical patch of 80 ft. with many cracks so it is easy for the climbers to reach the ledge above. There are many caves on this ledge with a water cistern too. The next patch is the mostdifficult part with almost no cracks to hold on but thankfully some permanent holes have been drilled to help fellow climbers. The top is merely 2 m in width but the view from the top is just astonishing. From there you can see all the nearby forts such as Sudhagad, Ghangad and Sarasgad in the horizon. From there you can rappel down almost 150 ft. till the first ledge.

Beas has its origin in Himalayas which is a major tributary of Sutlej and flows far and wide through Kullu &amp; Manali. It is a fierce river and kayaking along this one is pretty adventurous. Depending upon the organizers you choose the 16 km stretch could be divided. The first 7 km can be taken by non-swimmers too because one needs to strictly stick to guidelines by the instructors.  There is a reason why this river is said to be the best for extreme kayakers. It has got I \u2013 IV grade rapids. One should also be aware of the chilling water since it descends from Himalayas. Even the beginners can have a good time around this river but just have to be cautious with the river since it can be furious at certain spots. If you can\u2019t do kayaking you can roam around in jeep along the lower parts of the river.

This fort had strategic importance during the reign of Shahaji Raje, but it\u2019s not very famous for any historical event.</p><p>During the monsoon period, the steep hill offers exotic jungle-covered mountain scenery with waterfalls sliding down along the steep walls of this ancient fort.</p><p>The trek to Gorakhgad is incomplete without reaching the top of the pinnacle. The trekkers are attracted to this fort as they get opportunities for rock-climbing .</p><h3>Location </h3><p>From Mumbai, you can reach Murbad via Kalyan and if travelling from Pune, you need to go via Karjat. You can reach the base village Dehri by bus and jeeps which are easily available there.</p><p>You can also go to Gorakhgad from Siddhagad .From Murbad you have to go to Narivli village lying at its base. You will then have to decent from the top of Siddhagad, pass through the forest and climb a small plateau before finally reaching Gorakhgad.</p><p>Before commencing the climb, you can take a break and gather your energy in the temple of Gorakshanath as from there onwards, the climb becomes steeper and challenging.</p><h3>Sightseeing </h3><p>The top of the fort is very small. The main attraction is the deadly pinnacle of Machinndra. There is a small Mahadeo temple.\u00a0A small statue of Nandi and\u00a0a Lingi inside the temple are really attractive. The area on top is quite small with a small temple of Gorakhsanath. On the top, there is a centuries old cave, offering an extensive view of the valley and the tiny hamlets that adorn it. This cave can be used as a resting place.</p><p>There is a small Shiva Temple on the top of the cave, with number of monkeys hovering around it. Just near the cave, there are three water tanks carved out of stone.\u00a0The view from the top is spectacular as you can see the pinnacle of Machindragad with its imposing posture, Naneghat, Jivdhan, Ahupe Ghat  and the entire range up to Siddhagad .</p><p>The trek to Gorakhgad Fort offers a very thrilling and exciting experience to the trekkers!</p><h3>Precaution</h3><p>Be Careful of the sharp cliffs on the route while climbing and during monsoon when the rocks are slippery.</p><h3>Notes </h3><p>If you are doing a night trek to gorakhgad fort then make sure not to climb the final rock patch during night ...as it is little difficult during night.....just stay at the cave &amp; you can always climb that final rock patch in the morning. in the monsoon also,it's better not to try covering that part (after the Caves) patch while going up the temple as the rocks will be slippery.</p>", "image": "/Users/arshad/Dropbox/ARSHAD @ FITRANGI/Fitrangi.com DATABASE/DESTINATIONS/TRAVELLING & SIGHTSEEING/Forts & Caves/Gorakhgad Fort, Malshej Ghat, Maharashtra.jpg", "activity": "Forts & Caves", "type": "DESTINATION"}, {"category": "SKY - FLY", "title": "Zip-Line At Kolad,Maharashtra", "data": "<h3>About</h3><p>Travelling from one point to another can be done in many ways.

Reaching a top of the Everest is but a special one! As far as Maharashtra is concerned, reaching the summit of Kalsubai, theEVEREST OF MAHARASHTRA, should also be a special one! It is a dream of every sincere mountaineer to climb it at least once.</h3><h3>As per the legend, Kalsubaistayed in a nearby village as a young girl but hadmade conditionwith her employer that she will not do manual work. Whenforcedtodo,she fled to this hill. A temple is made in her glory on the top and villagers visit it often andoffergreen bangles to pleasethe goddess of women\u2019s liberation.</h3><h3>Location</h3><p>Kalsubai is situated in Ahmadnagar district at approximately 25-30 Km.South-East from Igatpuri. Igatpuri can be reached from Kalyan (or Mumbai) by boarding a train.A bus from Igatpuri to Bhandardara halts at Bari Village,at the foot of the mountain and at a height of 792m. An easy route leads to an upper plateau that has water. For a change , you can also descend by a different route. A route from the upper plateau traverses the mountain on the southern side, to decend to Udhavne (10km), which is served by busses to Bhandardara (16km on road) and from here buses are available towards Igatpuri.</p><h3>Sightseeing </h3><p>On the top of the peak is a small temple, which can seat at the most 3 people. The vastly spread out backwaters of Bhandardara attracts ones attention from the top. On the north we see the mountain range having forts like Ramsej, Achala, Ahivant, Saptashrungi, Markandya, Dhodap, Rawlya \u2013 Jawlya and Koldher.</p><p>To the east one can spot Aundh, Vishramgad, Alang, Madan, Kulang, Matheran and Harishchandragad. There has, however, been a massive deforestation on this mountain. One can spend around an hour on this peak before starting to descend back to the village.</p><h3>Precaution</h3><p>Please do have enough water stock from Bari itself, for there is no water source in between and though a well is there at the top it doesn't suit for drinking water. Also avoid going in summer.</p><h3>Notes </h3><p>It is an easy trek.

Many historical events took place here.</p><h3>It is a very tall fort and its huge size covers a diameter of almost 24 miles at its base. It is believed that only wind can roam around and water can pass through the thick forest surrounding the fort. Else, it is very difficult for anybody to pass through the thick jungles. This is the reason it was an unconquerable fort in Hindavi Swarajya. The structure of this fort gives us an insight to Shivaji Maharaj\u2019s sense of high-class architecture.</h3><h3>Location </h3><p>Rajgad fort is 42\u00a0km to the south west of Pune, about 15\u201316\u00a0km west ofNasrapur, in theSahyadrisrange. The different ways of reaching Rajgad are as follows:</p><p>From Pune, you have to go Vajeghar village by bus, which is a journey of about 2 hours. From Vajeghar you will reach village Pali in about 10-15 minutes. From Pali, you have to walk for about 2-3 hours to reach to the top by Pali Darwaja. This is the easiest but the longest route to Rajgad.</p><p>Rajgad can also be approached from village by Gunjavane Darwaja or Chor Darwaja which will take you to the Padmavati machi.</p><h3>Sightseeing </h3><h3>Padmavati lakeis very beautifully constructed. The walls of the lake are intact even today. An arch has been constructed from the continuation of the same wall to mark an entry to the lake.Padmavati devi Temple and  Rameshwar Temple attract many devotees.

You can also view the remains of the Rajwada castle.</h3><p>You can reach Pali Darwaja by climbing the stairs from the\u00a0Pali village. Pali darwaja is quite huge as even an elephant can enter through it. Gunjavane door is a series of three doors. The first door is simple one with strong fortified places on either side. The second door has a beautifully carved arch. At the third door, you can see carvings of two trunks of the elephants holding pots upside down.</p><p>Padmavati machi, which was not only a military base but also a residential zone, has the remains of temple of goddess Padmavati, tomb of Saibai, castel of constables, Padmavati Lake, secret doorway, Pali doorway, Gunjavane darwaja, storage yard of arms and ammunition on it. Alu darwaja Sanjivini Machi Suvela Machi and Citadel of Rajgad are the other interesting places to visit.
